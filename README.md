### Project Description

The Astronomical Gravity Simulator (AGS) is a tool to 
visualize how the gravitational force works on a macroscopic scale. 
Users add customizable planets to a screen and launch a satellite
which will orbit them (until it crashes) according to
the fundamental gravitational law:
$F_g=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$.

To use, add `Planets` using the `Add Planet` button.
You can choose their size, colour, and placement. 
Then add a `Satellite` using the `Add Satellite` button. 
You can choose their colour and placement. 
Press the `Launch` button to start the animation. 
You can pause and play at any point with the menu at the top, 
as well as see the speed and acceleration of the satellite.
